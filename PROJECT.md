# Project

## Hero

Our hero will be the playable character. He can build walls and in future will be able to upgrade the walls with the gold.

The hero has a limited life, along with other properties, such as speed. When his life reaches 0, the game ends, and the final score is displayed.

## Monsters

Monsters will be attacking our hero and the walls. They are stupid and basically can only go closer to the hero. If on their path they find a wall, they will demolish it after a set number of hits.

## Gold

You can gain gold by killing monsters.

You can spend gold by building stuff and upgrading your hero (e.g. increasing life and speed).

## Score

Score increases every time you do something. Will do a list of things that increase the score, but obviously the main thing you can do for improving your score will be killing monsters. Even time will be a factor for improving score.

## Waves

Will be waves of monsters. Wave 1, Wave 2, Wave 3... and the level of difficulty will increase, along with the number of monsters.
